# Data-Structure
An individual assignment project of Data Structure course (COMP 2012) of UniSA developed in Java. 
Its objective is to re-implement some of the Java Collections classes: LinkedList, Stack and Queue, 
then use them to create an infix-to-postfix converter and a postfix notation parser using Dijkstra’s ‘Shunting-Yard algorithm’.
